## Abstract

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/diffraction_discussion_visual.png" alt="Resolution discussion using ResoFox" width="400"/>
</p>


ResoFox is a Python-based graphical tool designed for theoretical analysis of neutron powder diffractometers. It focuses on evaluating the influence of optical components‚Äînamely collimators and monochromators‚Äîon diffraction peak resolution and relative intensity. The software is built upon the resolution model proposed by Caglioti et al. in 1958, combined with Bragg‚Äôs law and fundamental diffraction equations. It allows users to perform simulations under various geometric and optical configurations.

The tool features an integrated graphical interface and real-time plotting, capable of displaying:

Relative neutron beam intensity (luminosity)

Diffraction peak full width at half maximum (FWHM) and angular resolution

Theoretical powder diffraction patterns (supporting FCC and BCC lattices)

Beyond its computational capability, ResoFox also serves as a communication aid between sample users and instrument scientists. By providing visualized resolution versus angle plots and intensity trends, the tool enables non-specialist users to quickly estimate whether a given beamline configuration suits their experimental needs. This facilitates clearer technical discussions, speeds up experiment planning, and improves beamtime efficiency.

ResoFox was presented at the 2024 Taiwan Neutron Conference and has been benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulation results using McStas.

## Motivation and Background

Neutron diffraction is a vital technique for studying crystal structures and magnetism. Resolution and flux are two critical parameters in the design of neutron diffractometers. While Monte Carlo tools such as McStas offer detailed particle-level simulations, theoretical estimates of resolution and flux are more practical during the early stages of instrument design.

In 1958, Caglioti et al. proposed a widely adopted analytical model for calculating peak broadening using collimator divergences (Œ±‚ÇÅ, Œ±‚ÇÇ, Œ±‚ÇÉ) and monochromator mosaic spread (Œ≤). Based on this model, ResoFox was developed to provide a user-friendly and visualized environment that enables designers to rapidly evaluate performance under varying design parameters.

## Software Architecture and Functional Overview

ResoFox is developed in Python with a graphical user interface built using `tkinter`. Users can input the following parameters for simulation:

- Three collimator divergence angles: Œ±‚ÇÅ, Œ±‚ÇÇ, Œ±‚ÇÉ (in radians)
- Monochromator mosaic spread Œ≤ (in radians)
- Monochromator d-spacing and Bragg angle (in √Ö and degrees)
- Sample lattice constants a, b, c and lattice type (BCC = 1, FCC = 2)
- Neutron wavelength and plot color selection



### Output features include:
- Relative beam luminosity (not corrected for reflectivity)
- Minimum FWHM and resolution curve
- Theoretical powder diffraction pattern (2Œ∏ vs intensity), exportable as an image
- Full data tables displayed in the console, including each peak‚Äôs:
  - d-spacing, calculated lattice constant a,
  - FWHM, angular resolution, and lattice resolution (Œîd/d)

## üì§ Output and Data Export

ResoFox supports real-time export of plotted figures and data tables, including:

- Click the **"Save Image"** button in the GUI to export charts in `.png` format (e.g., 2Œ∏ vs intensity plots).  
  Click **"Export Data"** to export numerical results related to the diffraction peaks.

![output_fig1](docs/output_fig.png)
If the **"Clear Plot"** button is not clicked, users can re-enter new parameters and select a different color in the input panel to overlay diffraction patterns from different simulation conditions.
![output_fig2](docs/output_compare.png)

## üìã Console Output: Peak Angular Resolution Information

For each diffraction peak, the program automatically outputs the following resolution-related parameters:

- Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)
- Angular resolution
- Lattice resolution (Œîd/d)
- Standard deviation (if applicable)

These values can be further compared against Monte Carlo simulation results (e.g., McStas) or experimental data.

## Validation Against Classical Theory: Caglioti et al. (1958)

To validate the correctness of ResoFox calculations, we reproduced the analytical resolution model proposed by G. Caglioti et al. (1958), which relates the full width at half maximum (FWHM) to beam luminosity (L) under different collimator angular divergences (Œ±‚ÇÅ, Œ±‚ÇÇ, Œ±‚ÇÉ) and a fixed monochromator mosaic spread (Œ≤ = 20 arcmin).

The plot is generated using ResoFox under the same conditions. Each dot represents a different collimator configuration, color-coded by  (a = 0, 1.5, 3).

The results demonstrate strong agreement with the classical model, successfully replicating the characteristic trend between luminosity and resolution. This confirms the analytical validity of ResoFox for preliminary instrument performance estimation.


![Validation vs Caglioti 1958](docs/validation_vs_caglioti1958.png)


‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values exported by ResoFox are in radians. They must be converted to arcminutes for proper comparison with the classic results presented by G. Caglioti *et al.*.  
Additionally, the relative intensity values calculated by ResoFox must be multiplied by a scaling factor in order to align with the intensity axis in the reference plots of G. Caglioti *et al.*. In this case, the scaling factor used is **4 √ó 10¬π‚Å∞**.

## Input Configuration Example (ResoFox vs. McStas)

The figure below shows a side-by-side comparison of the input interfaces used in ResoFox (left) and McStas (right). Both allow the definition of neutron diffractometer geometries and simulation parameters.


![Input interface comparison](docs/resofox_mcstas_input_demo.png)



üìå Important note:
- In ResoFox, collimator divergence is entered in **radians**;
- In McStas, the divergence input is in **arcminutes**.

By matching the input parameters shown in the figure, users can replicate and compare the simulated diffraction patterns of silver powder (Ag.laz) using both tools.

McStas also provides sample materials; the example shown is a powder sample (`Ag.laZ`). To test different materials, users can simply change the sample name in the `sample` field of the McStas interface. The outputs from FCC and BCC lattice types can then be directly compared.


![Sample Image](docs/samples.png)

A full comparison of the angular resolution results between ResoFox‚Äôs theoretical model and McStas simulations has been published on arXiv. Input files and analysis outputs are included in the `examples/` directory.

üîç Note: The figure shown here uses HOPG as the monochromator crystal, while the arXiv paper uses Ge(115). This difference is intentional to offer readers broader cross-validation and configuration flexibility.

## Comparison with McStas Simulation Results

To validate the consistency between ResoFox analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we conducted a benchmark test using McStas. The simulation models a HOPG(002) monochromator operating at a neutron wavelength of Œª = 1.65 √Ö, targeting a silver (Ag) powder sample. The comparison is illustrated in the figure below:

![Comparison with McStas](docs/comparison_with_mcstas.png)



Overall, the positions and trends of the diffraction peaks show strong agreement between the two tools, confirming that ResoFox provides reliable predictions of resolution and intensity based on geometric optics theory.

üîç Possible reasons for the slight differences in peak heights:

Statistical noise in Monte Carlo simulation:
McStas employs Monte Carlo ray tracing, which can lead to fluctuations or sharp spikes in intensity near strong diffraction peaks when the number of simulated particles is insufficient. In contrast, ResoFox uses an analytical model, resulting in smoother and noise-free intensity profiles.

Normalization differences:
In this comparison, global normalization of total intensity was not applied. Instead, both datasets were aligned based on the main peak, which may cause minor discrepancies in the relative intensity of secondary peaks.
