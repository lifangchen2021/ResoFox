## Abstract

ResoFox is a Python-based graphical tool designed for theoretical analysis of neutron powder diffractometers. It focuses on evaluating the influence of optical components‚Äînamely collimators and monochromators‚Äîon diffraction peak resolution and relative intensity. The software is built upon the resolution model proposed by Caglioti et al. in 1958, combined with Bragg‚Äôs law and fundamental diffraction equations. It allows users to perform simulations under various geometric and optical configurations.

The tool features an integrated graphical interface and real-time plotting, capable of displaying:
- Relative neutron beam intensity (luminosity)
- Diffraction peak full width at half maximum (FWHM) and angular resolution
- Theoretical powder diffraction patterns (supporting FCC and BCC lattices)

ResoFox was presented at the 2024 Taiwan Neutron Conference and has been benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulation results using McStas.

## Motivation and Background

Neutron diffraction is a vital technique for studying crystal structures and magnetism. Resolution and flux are two critical parameters in the design of neutron diffractometers. While Monte Carlo tools such as McStas offer detailed particle-level simulations, theoretical estimates of resolution and flux are more practical during the early stages of instrument design.

In 1958, Caglioti et al. proposed a widely adopted analytical model for calculating peak broadening using collimator divergences (Œ±‚ÇÅ, Œ±‚ÇÇ, Œ±‚ÇÉ) and monochromator mosaic spread (Œ≤). Based on this model, ResoFox was developed to provide a user-friendly and visualized environment that enables designers to rapidly evaluate performance under varying design parameters.

## üîß Requirements
This software requires Python 3.7+ and the following packages:

```
pip install matplotlib pillow pandas
```
tkinter is included by default in most Python distributions (Windows/macOS).
For Linux users, if the GUI does not launch, install tkinter with:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
## üì¶ Module Functions
Package	Purpose
tkinter	Build the graphical user interface (GUI) for input/output interaction
pillow	Load and render image files in the GUI (e.g., logos, figures)
matplotlib	Generate resolution/intensity plots and output figures
pandas	Handle tabular data (e.g., export diffraction results to CSV)
math, csv, io, base64	Built-in Python libraries for computation, file handling, and encoding


## Software Architecture and Functional Overview

ResoFox is developed in Python with a graphical user interface built using `tkinter`. Users can input the following parameters for simulation:

- Three collimator divergence angles: Œ±‚ÇÅ, Œ±‚ÇÇ, Œ±‚ÇÉ (in radians)
- Monochromator mosaic spread Œ≤ (in radians)
- Monochromator d-spacing and Bragg angle (in √Ö and degrees)
- Sample lattice constants a, b, c and lattice type (BCC = 1, FCC = 2)
- Neutron wavelength and plot color selection

### Output features include:
- Relative beam luminosity (not corrected for reflectivity)
- Minimum FWHM and resolution curve
- Theoretical powder diffraction pattern (2Œ∏ vs intensity), exportable as an image
- Full data tables displayed in the console, including each peak‚Äôs:
  - d-spacing, calculated lattice constant a,
  - FWHM, angular resolution, and lattice resolution (Œîd/d)

üì∑ GUI Interface Example:

## üñ®Ô∏è Output and Data Export

ResoFox supports real-time generation and export of both plots and data tables:

- Users can save generated plots‚Äîsuch as diffraction patterns (2Œ∏ vs intensity) and resolution curves‚Äîas `.png` images via the **Save Image** button in the GUI.
- The program automatically prints detailed diffraction peak data‚Äîincluding 2Œ∏, d-spacing, resolution, and relative intensity‚Äîto the console and optionally saves it as  `.csv` files.
- All output files are UTF-8 encoded and compatible with Excel or other scientific plotting software for downstream analysis.


## üìã Console Output: Angular Resolution per Peak

The program automatically outputs the following resolution-related information for each diffraction angle:

- Calculated lattice constant (a-value)
- Full width at half maximum (FWHM) in degrees
- Angular resolution
- Lattice resolution (Œîd/d)
- Standard deviation (if applicable)

These data can be used for further comparison with Monte Carlo simulations (e.g., McStas) or experimental results.

## Validation Against Classical Theory: Caglioti et al. (1958)

ResoFox simulation results have been benchmarked against the analytical curves published by G. Caglioti et al. (1958). The following comparison shows the relationship between FWHM and luminosity under three representative conditions (a = 0, 1.5, 3):

![Validation vs Caglioti 1958](docs/validation_vs_caglioti1958.png)

The result confirms that the computed resolution and intensity trends are in strong agreement with classical theory, validating the correctness of the implementation.

## Example Input Configuration (ResoFox vs McStas)

The following figure shows a side-by-side comparison of input interfaces for ResoFox and McStas:

![Input interface comparison](docs/resofox_mcstas_input_demo.png)

The left panel shows ResoFox‚Äôs GUI input interface, while the right panel displays the McStas configuration interface.  
Sample McStas input files and parameter documentation are included in the `examples/` folder for download and testing.

## Comparison with McStas Simulation Results

To verify the consistency between ResoFox‚Äôs analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulation results, a benchmark was conducted using McStas to simulate powder diffraction of silver (Ag) with a Ge(115) monochromator at Œª = 1.65 √Ö. The comparison is shown below:

![Comparison with McStas](docs/comparison_with_mcstas.png)

The figure compares diffraction patterns generated by ResoFox (top) and McStas (bottom). The diffraction peak positions align closely across the two tools, confirming that ResoFox provides accurate predictions of lattice geometry and Bragg condition.  
Although peak intensities exhibit slight differences, this is expected as ResoFox uses idealized theoretical calculations without incorporating reflectivity, Lorentz factors, or detector response effects. Nevertheless, the overall peak sequence and distribution are consistent, demonstrating ResoFox‚Äôs utility as a rapid modeling and design validation tool.
